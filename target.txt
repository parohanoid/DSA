Arrays / Strings (sliding window + binary search)

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Sliding Window)

Maximum Sum of Subarrays of Size K (Sliding Window)

Search in Rotated Sorted Array (Binary Search)

Intervals (super common)

Merge Intervals

Non-Overlapping Intervals

Stack (stack tricks are hot in interviews)

Valid Parentheses (warm-up)

Daily Temperatures

Linked List (you will get at least one)

Linked List Cycle

Remove Nth Node From End of List

Trees / Graphs (bread and butter)

Maximum Depth of a Binary Tree (DFS)

Number of Islands (DFS/BFS)

Bonus (if time remains)

Word Search (Backtracking, medium but classic)

Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (Greedy, easy win if asked)

That’s 12 problems total. If you can solve/explain these, you’ll hit most of the “expected” interview buckets: arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, and intervals. That’s a well-rounded set.
